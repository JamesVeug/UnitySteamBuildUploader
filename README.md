## Upload Tab
<a href="https://imgur.com/pBnYzJR"><img src="https://imgur.com/pBnYzJR.png" alt="Git-Sync-Tab-Pic" border="0"></a>

Specify where you want builds to come from and where you want them to go.
- You can specify a file/file on your computer or choose from your Unity Cloud builds.
- Choose where you want the build to go (Steam depot & branch)
- Add any additional modifiers to change the build before uploading
- Set a description to appear on steam
- Click Download and Upload all

**NOTE: You can not upload to the default branch (default branch everyone uses). This is on purpose to avoid uploading the wrong build, Also the SDK does not allow this.**


## Unity Cloud Tab (Optional)
<a href="https://imgur.com/PNFJd87"><img src="https://imgur.com/PNFJd87.png" alt="Git-Unity-Cloud-Pic" border="0"></a>

Utilize Unity Cloud to automate make builds of your project.
- Tracks progress of current builds
- Start a new build
- Download builds

## How does it work?

<a href="https://imgur.com/3cKv2zs"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3cKv2zs.png" alt="Upload process" border="0"></a>

When pressing the `Download and Upload all` button the editor starts an async Build Task to begin the upload process.

The Build Task has a number of steps that it goes through sequentially while its uploading. Each step is async and fires for each Build Config at the same time. When a Step is complete for all Build Configs it will proceed to the next step.

> NOTE: If any Build Config fails at any point then the whole build task will cancel and notify the user of the issue.

### 1. Get Source

Download the build from the selected source
eg: Choose File/Folder will save that location
eg: Choose Unity Cloud will download the build from Unity Cloud


### 2. Cache Source

This will copy the selected contents from Source to a cache folder.

`%userprofile%/appdata/locallow/<companyname>/<productname>/BuildUploader/CachedBuilds`

The copied contents are required to be a folder and not a file or zip. The build step will unzip the contents.

### 3. Modify Cached Contents

This is where modifiers are applied to the cached contents.
- Remove DoNotShip files/folders
- Apply Steam DRM
- etc

### 4. Upload Contents

This is the final step where everything is expected to be valid and ready to upload to the selected Destination.

Each build config will upload at the same time.

> NOTE: If 1 build fails to upload it does NOT prevent the others from uploading.
> 
> Example: Steam has the incorrect login credentials.
> 
> You can test the build before uploading by selecting `Nowhere` as the destination and disabling Deleting Caching in preferences. 
> This will still go through the same process but not upload the build anywhere.

### 5. Cleanup

After the upload is complete the cache folder is deleted (Unless specified in Preferences to not)

## Known Issues ü™≥
- Steam Two-Factor authentication requires you to enter the steam guard code manually every time you upload
  - I Don't know why pressing "Confirm that's me" doesn't work, and it does not cache this locally like the Steam Guard Code.
